The great thing about hearing Matt speak is he finds a way to humbly demonstrate exactly HOW he and his clients leverage technology to gain better insight into their operation, more efficiently execute on their mission and bridge the gap between effort and outcome.  His presentations are chocked full of stories, media and images which Matt references to prove his points.  The audience perceives him as credible and passionate.  I highly recommend Matt for anyone looking for consulting services for online fundraising!
